# fibonacci

	  A Fibonacci sequence is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceding two.
	  For example, the first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.
	  
	  The Fibonacci challenge usually goes something like this: 
    write a function that return the nth entry in the Fibonacci sequence, where n is a number you pass in as argument to the function.
